## About Me

I am a PhD student in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) at the University of Calabria, Italy, specializing in Big Data analysis, Artificial Intelligence, and Distributed Systems. My research focuses on optimizing the performance of machine learning applications on Big Data. I have contributed to several projects, including enhancing cryptocurrency price forecasting by integrating machine learning with social media and market data, multi-dimensional classification on social media data using large language models, and developing multimodal approaches to detect false information on social media. In addition to my research, I serve as a university lecturer at the University of Calabria and collaborate as a visiting researcher at the University of Cambridge. I am passionate about leveraging advanced technologies to address complex problems and am committed to contributing to the academic and research community.
